		description:
			"A drawing of a detailed eye with a dark figure in the centre. This drawing's purpose is to show the intense emotions or reaction to being confronted with something inconceivable, whether it be good or bad, within you or in front of you. Inspired by Nietzsche's quote: 'Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.' The drawing was created using a range of black and white pastels, on PastelMat paper. I choose to draw in grey-tone to emphasise the values, creating dramatic lighting and a deep atmosphere. The resulting image is realistic, yet expressive.",

			"I am very glad to welcome you to my store. Let me present to your attention my author's digital paintings that are composed into wooden canvases on old vintage boards. I use real old boards with a long history as a canvas basis, some of them being over 50 years old. In order to prepare the canvas, I order these boards from my partners. A team of ten people get this wood from different remote regions of Russia by dismantling old buildings that are more than 50 years old. These real old boards have a unique texture and patterns - natural cracks, chips and artifacts gained over time. If I create canvases for my paintings, even from a limited collection, there won’t be the same canvases with the same texture. I thoroughly select the boards with the most beautiful and vintage drawings. Each canvas is unique! I consider this to be an environmentally friendly process since it’s like giving a second life to this wood in the form of artistic interior paintings. All canvases are collected in my workshop in Moscow.",

Pabbay is now uninhabited but was once very fertile and known for the illicit whisky distilleries. The island was cleared for sheep in 1846. Pabbay is traditionally a home of The Clan Morrison which is the clan my mother was born into.',
